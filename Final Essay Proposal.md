## "What Should Economists Do?"
    - In the paper "What Should Economists Do?" Written by James Buchanan, the point is raised that Economists, in a general sense, have strayed very far away from the optimal output that their school of thought has the potential to have. 
    - Buchanan argues that most economists have been drawn to the security of applied mathematical models.  He proposes that the focus that has been stressed on the "economic problem" of scarcity has lead most economisits to think that there must be a solution to this misuse of resources.  This obsession to find a solution has trasnformed the study of the political economy to be more mathematically intensive than ever intended.  
    - Buchanan seeks to better define the field of economics by recommending a completely different term to label this particular field of study.  He uses the word "catallitics" and "symbiotics", which he explains as "The study of association between dissimilar organisms...".  I found this to be particularly interesting because computational schools of thought in economics seek to assume that we all act the same and have all of the same information to make certain decisions.  These absurd assumptions compromise the validity of many of these models, but when we seek to observe and study how we interact under certain circumstances given certain available information, we can much more effectively predict market movements.  
    -In my previous paragraph I somewhat answered the questions "What does Buchanan suggest that economists do differently?".  However to clarify, Buchanan doesn't suggest that all mathematical models and computational approaches are folly, but that we need to adjust our focus.  Instead of trying to find the economic solution to the economic problem, we need to discover characteristics of the associations between the entities in our markets.
    
    
## Essay Topic 
    - The topic I want to propose has to do with a combination of computational strategies and behavioral economics.  I do not think that they should be seperate entities and I imagine most economists would agree with me.  I agree with Buchanan with respect to a transition in the primary focus of economists from a soltuion oriented approach to a behavioral observation approach however, I think that within the sphere of behavioral observation, there are solutions to correct inefficiencies and irrational behavior.

##  Proposal

I strongly agree with Buchanans assertion of the issue with the current focus of economists, again in a general sense.  However, what if we are able to pair our computational approaches to problems with observations of behavioral similarities that we observe in markets?  I think that humans, although unpredicatable and irrational in many situations, have similar end goals in many situations, such as economic well-being, good health, and happiness.  I understand that these may have wide scopes, or in other words that people have differing definitons of all of these, but perhaps we can effectively group people, based on observebal preferences, based on their preferred definition of economic well-being, good health, and happiness.  

## Abstract  

In this paper I seek to identify possible ways that we can include simulations of different circumstances to compile empirical data about behavioral economics. 

I am afraid I am unsure how I could write a more in depth absract to a paper that I have not fully outlined, or thought out yet.  I want to come to a conclusion about my question, but I need to do a lot more research and thinking in order to effectively compile an abstract. 


## Introduction

According to James Buchanan, an economist should focus on studying the mutually beneficial association between dissimilar organisms.  Although Buchanan may not had known it at the time, he was touching on a relatively new field of economics based on observing behavioral tendincies in markets.  In Buchanans' paper "What Should Economists Do?", he identifies the issue with the current mathematical obsession that seems to have taken over the economists field, in this paper I want to try and create a happy medium where we can usu computational methods to establish empircal data that helps us maximize the mutually beneficial assocation that we have with everyone we transact with in our current markets.  Simulation with the assistance of artificial intelligence is an avenue that we must look at in a very serious way to try and understand the behavior we can expect to see in any scenario.
