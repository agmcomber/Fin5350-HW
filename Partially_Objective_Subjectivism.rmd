    "## What Should Economists Do?\n",
    "\n",
    "\tWe can study some of the most brilliant minds that have covered the ambiguous topic of Economics with our infinite access to online databases and academic journals.  The fascinating members of academia give us unique insights to the development of modern economic theory and provide us with a wide array of economic thought ranging from an applied mathematical model to strictly philosophical approaches.  Adam G. Martin will categorize these two significantly different approaches into two schools of thought, objective and subjective.  I would propose that it is not as black and white as Martin identifies, and this isn’t to suggest that Martin was erroneous in his assumption but rather, for simplicity sake, he maintained that there were two categories.  To begin to identify additional categories of economic thought it is helpful to extract similarities and differences between objective and subjective thinkers.  For this paper, I have chosen James M. Buchanan and Richard Thaler.  Thaler, one of the foremost thinkers in Behavioral Economics, is considered to be a predominantly objective economic thinker while Buchanan, most famous for his work on public choice theory, is considered to be a subjective thinker.  \n",

    "## What is Economics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the most divisive points between these two schools of thought can be broken down by a couple of basic questions.  “What is Economics?” and “What is the role of an Economist?”.  Economics can be readily defined as a study that is concerned with the production, consumption and transfer of wealth.  I find this to be a very general and accurate definition, the divisive points, however, arise when economists are trying to figure out how to measure and observe the intricacies of wealth.   \n",
    "First, let’s establish what Thaler and Buchanan would both agree Economics is not.  Buchanan stated, “Once we become methodologically trapped in the maximization paradigm, economics becomes applied mathematics or engineering.”  Buchanan is strongly opposed to the idea that Economics is some hard science that is abound with concrete solutions that we simply must discover using advanced mathematical equations.  The basis of this opposition rests in his contradicting view of the “Economic Problem”.  This “problem” is embodied in the maximization paradigm that is mentioned in the quote above, which suggests that there is a scarcity issue with all resources and it is the economists job to figure out how to maximize the utility of all resources by allocating them in a certain way.  The maximization models that are used by most objectivists assume a very rational human that is completely predictable which is an ideal that simply doesn’t exist. To this point subjectivists raise the objection, why would you create such complicated explanatory models about people who don’t exist?  Thaler accentuates this point in his book Misbehaving, “The purely economic man is indeed close to being a social moron. Economic theory has been much preoccupied with this rational fool.”  Thaler does not think that the study of economics should be spending so much time on trying to plain a nonexistent place with idealized agents.  Thaler makes a sweeping claim for all economics who study in the behavioralists field of economics, “We behavioralists differ from our more traditional brethren in the way we characterize agents in the economy.”, amplifying his existing view on what economics should be.  Agents in the economy of subjectivists don’t have all the information, neither can they hope to have all available information because it simply is unattainable, whereas the objectivist Agent assumes that an Economic Man has all available information to make rational, calculated choices.  This bizarre assumption would contend that everyone acts in uniform ways and responds to situations in similar fashion.  I think that you would be hard pressed to find someone to agree with the assumption that all people act like this, but for some reason, economists have been computing complex mathematical models to explain irrational behavior and using intense algorithms to predict unpredictable behavior.  Thaler strongly refutes the existence of Homo Economicus, or the Economic Man, who can act rationally at every choice presented to him and do so with all available information at his fingertips, a view that is shared with by Buchanan.   \n",
    " Now to the point of the objectivist with respect to the maximization paradigm, I don’t think any economist would argue that resources are finite.  It is a fact that we live in a finite world and we have scarce resources but many economists under the same school of thought as Buchanan would argue that it is not an economists job to discover that maximum utility that can be derived from the allocation of said resources.  Buchanan goes on to clarify that perhaps his is an argument of etymology and we should just rename the study of economics, which seems a bit absurd because if you must rename the very thing that you are defending the definition of, then perhaps you have misplaced your argumentative efforts. But I digress.  The most accurate definition I found that Buchanan has used to label economics comes from his paper “What Should Economists Do?”, “Mans behavior in the market relationship, reflecting the propensity to truck and to barter and the manifold variations in structure that this relationship can take: these are the proper subjects for the economist’s study.”  Economics will always be about studying the production, consumption and transfer of wealth but we can understand most about our own economy by observing the behavior of the average human in any given environment.  Most, if not all, economists would concur that humans act on impulses and irrationally more often than not.  Most of human behavior cannot be predicted simply because our emotions are unpredictable.  A good example that simplifies this concept has to do with the Law of Demand.  According to one of the most basic and widely accepted economic models, the Law of Demand, we are told that if the price for any given good is reduced, people will buy more of it and vice versa.  I would say that in most cases this model works perfectly but why do we catch ourselves questioning the validity of something when the price seems “too low”? What constitutes in our mind that something is “too low”.  This is what Buchanan thinks we should be studying.  Why do humans act certain ways and how does this influence the relationship that exists within our markets?  These are questions that Behavioralists have posed and have used to define their entire field of study.  Behavioral economists seek to explain why humans act certain ways in markets by combining fields of psychology and the more traditional economics. \n",

    "## What is the Role of Economics?\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point it seems that there are a lot of very similar viewpoints that are share between Thaler and Buchanan.  But, the main point of disagreement between Thaler and Buchanan perhaps isn’t what economics is and how it should be studied, but rather the application of such studies.  Behavioral economics teaches us that humans are not great decision makers.  We make decisions for the wrong reasons and allow irrational thoughts to govern our choices.  These choices are so important to the study of economics because “Economics is about making choices” (Buchanan), we are presented with hundreds of situations every day that cause us to evaluate opportunity cost, weigh pros and cons, and eventually decide.  These decisions are based on information that we have, information that we don’t have and information that we don’t know that we don’t have.  It’s quite obvious that the latter two points cause us to make bad decisions but even if we have all the information we still tend to make poor decisions, so how can we fix this?  Thaler likes to use the example of taking a mortgage out on a house: \n",
    "\n",
    "…lenders could be required to offer some mortgages they call “plain vanilla,” with uniform terms. There might be one vanilla 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage and one five-year, adjustable-rate mortgage. The features of these plain mortgages would be uniform, much as in a standard lease used in most rental agreements.\n",
    "Lenders would also be free to offer other exotic mortgages — perhaps called “rocky road” mortgages? — along with the vanilla variety, but these offerings would receive more intense scrutiny from regulators.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thaler identifies a subject that many people find difficult to navigate and offers a solution to help people avoid unintended consequences that come as a result of a lack of knowledge surrounding buying a property and taking out a loan.  Instead of trying to educate everyone on this subject, which can prove extremely difficult, costly and unrealistic, we can minimize the options that inexperienced home buyers have.  This wouldn’t remove freedom to choose your mortgages but it would warn people that there are many risks that are associated with complicated mortgages that only experienced home buyers, or those with help from a professional should use.  Thaler likens this to the many options you have on a ski run.  You are free to choose any run but there are clearly labeled signs that dissuade less experienced skiers from trying to complete difficult runs and which saves them from discomfort, stress and injury.  This application of behavioral economics amplifies the relationship between borrowers and lenders alike.  This strategy allows for a safer and more reliable exchange of wealth.   Thaler never claims that there is a nudge for every little choice that we are faced with in our daily lives, nor does he suggest that there is an overarching solution to our daily mistakes that can be solved by one expert.  However, he does think, and I agree with this, that for large decisions that are made by most people at least once in their lifetime, such as taking out a mortgage, buying a car, taking out a loan (to name a few financial examples), there are easily identifiable optimal solutions that give people advantages in their decision-making process.  Notice that there is not forcible action taking place but transparent and easily accessible advice being offered that would enhance the outcome of these financial decisions.  \n",
    "\tI would imagine that the first objection that Buchanan would raise to this proposal is “who nudges the nudger”.  In other words, who can make sure that the bureaucrats that are charged with developing these nudges have the properly aligned incentives to ensure that: First that the nudges are the optimal solution for said subjects, and second, the subjects of these nudges are able to clearly understand the intention of the nudge and can opt out of it whenever they please.  There will obviously have to be some assumptions that we make while deciding what these nudges influence.  As to not get carried away by the design of a well-made nudge because this is not the purpose of this paper, we will stick to the mortgage example that was given above.  The only assumptions that we are making, and I would hardly call these assumptions but rather a universal rational held by all people involved in modern markets, is that people want to retain as much money as possible while buying a house.  So, the optimal solution for this nudge seems quite clear, push people towards the mortgage that allows them to retain as much money as possible while clearly outlining certain risks that they can opt in or out of depending on their financial competency.  This will deter poor decisions for people with less financial prowess and keep banks safe from bad investments.  The second point of argument might be the most difficult to resolve and is a key argument for opponents of nudges.  How can we ensure that nudges are transparent and easy to opt out of when it seems that a key incentive for the “nudger” is to get as many people possible to opt in to these nudges?  For private businesses, regulation is obviously out of the question because it is a bit out of reach for these companies, but I would propose that the Invisible Hand might play a bigger role in this than we think.  If we choose to opt out of nudges given to us, we are signaling to whatever entity is offering this nudge that we do not like or agree with what the nudge would push us to do.  So, if the nudge is ethical and the corporation presenting it does in fact want the best for its subjects, whether they be customers or employees, the company would then change the nudge to explain more clearly how they intend to help the customer and the overall benefit.  For example, if a nudge from a company seeks to help its employees retire with a legitimate 401k, an ethical and worthy goal, and its employees aren’t responding to it, they can change it to get better reactions from their subjects.   As far as governmental issued nudges go I think that regulation on “nudgers” and rules they must go by can help keep nudges transparent and maintain the integrity that Thaler always intended that they have. “All nudging should be transparent and never misleading.  It should be as easy as possible to opt out of the nudge, preferably with as little as one mouse click.  There should be good reason to believe that the behavior being encouraged will improve the welfare of those being nudged.”\n",
    "But apart from these political details that would have to be tested and reworked to get right, does Buchanan not agree with this course of study? “Economics is…the study of the association between dissimilar organisms, and the connotation of the term is that the association is mutually beneficial to all parties.” there are obvious similarities in the style of thinking between Buchanan and Thaler here.  To study the association of dissimilar organisms sounds to me like the study of dissimilar humans, or humans with different desires, tastes, rational etc.  By studying these associations, we can create nudges that allow for a better relationship to be cultivated between man and the ever-evolving market around him.    \n",

    "## Subjectivity or Objectivity\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, I must disagree with Adam Martins categorical placement of Behavioral economics under objective thinking, on these grounds:  Behavioral Economists recognize that most people are uninformed.  As I quoted earlier in my paper, Thaler disagrees with the more “traditional brethren” in how they characterize agents in the economy.  Behavioral economists also posit that humans act irrationally and for these reasons models are ineffective in explaining most human behavior.  However, I don’t believe that it is wholly subjective either.  Thaler suggests that there are “right answers” to certain problems in markets.  Such as “the right mortgage” or “the right retirement plan”, these are examples that Thaler uses to try and solidify the useful nature of nudges.  Critics of behavioral economics suggest that the “experts” making the decisions are basically the same concept as the economic man, but I disagree.  I think these agents that behavioralists posit as experts are simply regular humans with a specialized knowledge in a certain area.  But does this really “exemplify” objective logic of action as Martin observes?  I don’t think so.  It seems to me that the behavioralists approach is one of partially objective subjectivism.  This label aims to recognize that there are “best choices” according to the limited knowledge that we currently have but doesn’t deny the existence of unknown unknowns or even known unknowns.  This concept goes back to the very basic idea that Adam Smith labled “specialization”.  We can’t all be experts on mortgages, loans and long term investments, just to name a few financial examples, so why shouldn’t we be excited for nudges that help us make, in general, more responsible decisions.   Perhaps Thaler put it more eloquently than I, “Some critics contend that behavioral economists have neglected the obvious fact that bureaucrats make errors, too. But this misses the point. After all, wouldn’t you prefer to have a qualified, albeit human, technician inspect your aircraft’s engines rather than do it yourself?”  There is no claim in behavioral economics that says we can eradicate bad decisions with nudges because those who nudge are also imperfect beings with limited knowledge, but we can begin to mitigate obvious poor choices that irrational misinformed humans make every day.  Buchanan might respond by stating in a stern fashion “this is not economics” but rather a managerial science of sorts.  I would again disagree using Buchanan’s own words he uses to define economics “This mutuality of advantage that may be secured by different organisms as a result of cooperative arrangements, be these simple or complex, is the one important truth in our discipline.”  Is a nudge not an observance of human psychological properties and predictable action, which is then used to secure an advantage because of cooperative arrangements?  I enjoy reading the, dare I say, Crusade against objective models that Buchanan engaged in.  I particularly enjoyed his citation of his mentor “most of the empirical work in economics is proving water runs downhill”.  I couldn’t agree more with this.  I believe Economics is so much bigger than mathematical models.  Economics seeks to explain the beautiful intricacies of the relationships that we naturally develop with each other because of our propensity to interact with one another.  Behavioral Economics seeks to study these relationships and begin to put into practice elements of a psychological nudge to help the interactions that we engage in everyday result in more effective trade.  I don’t think that we are anywhere close to obtaining the most optimal solution possible but if we have discovered ways to improve the outcome of our choices by even just a little why wouldn’t we share them with others?  We make no claims that we have a perfect solution but we have found better ones.  \n"
